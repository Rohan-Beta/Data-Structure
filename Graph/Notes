* 4 ways to create graph

i. Adjacency List : We use this because of its time complexity and it is better than Adjacency Matrix

ii. Adjacency Matrix : We generally not use this because it occupy more space as compared Adjacency List and for its time complexity

iii. Edge List : We use this for MST(Minimum Spanning Tree) , which sort the graph

iv. Implicit Graph : We use this for flood fill algorithm , it also give shortest path in matrix by moving left , right , up , down

We mostly use Adjacency List graph

* 2 ways to traverse in graph

i. BFS (Breadth First Search)

ii. DFS (Depth First Search)


* Dijkstras Algorithm and Bellman Ford Algorithm

Dijkstras Algorithm works only in positive graph but Bellman Ford Algorithm works on both (negative and positive) graph.
We use Dijkstras instead of Bellman because of its time complexity.
Dijkstras time complexity is lower than Bellman time complexity.
