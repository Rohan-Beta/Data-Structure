* 4 ways to create graph

i. Adjacency List : We use this because of its time complexity and it is better than Adjacency Matrix

ii. Adjacency Matrix : We generally not use this because it occupy more space as compared Adjacency List and for its time complexity

iii. Edge List : We use this for MST(Minimum Spanning Tree) , which sort the graph

iv. Implicit Graph : We use this for flood fill algorithm , it also give shortest path in matrix by moving left , right , up , down

We mostly use Adjacency List graph

* 2 ways to traverse in graph

i. BFS (Breadth First Search)

ii. DFS (Depth First Search)
